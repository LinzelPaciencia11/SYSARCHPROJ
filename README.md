# Git workflow explanation

To Implement Git Branching & Workflow
me and my partner will each create at least two feature branches for different tasks using the command:
`git checkout -b feature-branch-name`
This ensures that we can work on separate features without interfering with the main branch.

Once we complete our assigned tasks, we will stage and commit the changes using:
`git add .`
`git commit -m "feat: <comment>"`

After committing, we will push our feature branches to the remote repository with:
`git push origin feature-branch-name`
Then, we will create a Pull Request (PR) to propose merging our feature branch into the main branch.

after, for the Pull Requests & Code Reviews
-me and my partner will review each otherâ€™s PRs to check for code quality and functionality.
If necessary, we will provide feedback through comments.
Before merging, we must resolve any conflicts to ensure a smooth integration.
Only after addressing all issues will we approve and merge the feature branch into the main branch.
